# supallama-studio

I built a cross platform desktop app that uses a local llamafile LLM to turn user stories into code. 

I built it in Python using toga

It uses uses crewai/LangChain powered by a locally running llamafile to generate code based on a user's request. 

It's a very early proof of concept right now.
